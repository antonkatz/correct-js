Add following to your *package.json*:\n```\n\"scripts\": {\n    \"clear-logs\": \"node node_modules/@onest.network/correct-js/babel/delete-logs.js\"\n  }  \n```\n\nAdding `CORRECT_JS_STRICT=false` to your env will log warnings instead of throwing errors\n\n#### Current limitations\nThe provided build is made for nodejs and does not work in the browser.\nYou can still run your tests and thus get the benefits.  \n\n## Lib\n\nRevolves around providing an opinionated way to encapsulate data objects \n- [x] preventing accidental access to non-existent values\n- [x] preventing state/data mutation outside of internal functions\n- [x] preventing initialization with missing data\n- [ ] ease of serialization/export of parts of encapsulated data/state\n\nTo prevent checks during runtime, add `CORRECT_JS_ENV=production` or `NODE_ENV=production` to your env\n\n## Performance\nWhen building and running with `NODE_ENV=production` the *Babel plugin* is disabled,\nand majority of correctness checks inside the *lib* as well\n",
